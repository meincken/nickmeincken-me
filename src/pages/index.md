  description: >
    I am an experienced AEM Front End Developer. I specialise in creating clean
    semantic code to ensure fast load times. A champion of atomic design
    principles and where possible, develop style guides and pattern libraries to
    ensure consistent and rapid development when working as part of a team. I am
    as comfortable coding in raw HTML as I am using products such as React. I
    enjoy working as part of an Agile team and have worked on some of the
    countries largest e-commerce sites.
